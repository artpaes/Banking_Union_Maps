          <p>The health of the European banking system has come back into the media spotlight. Last week’s fall in bank shares; the creation of the Italian “bad bank”; and Britain’s demands to shield its banks from rules governing the Euro region; are examples that suggest that the debate on the design and functioning of the European banking regulatory architecture will be on the table in the following months.<br><br>Given the complex and evolving nature of the European banking regulation, there is much confusion about what has already been established and what plans are under discussion. We hope to clarify the current and proposed state of the European bank regulatory architecture.We differentiate which rules and institutions form the so-called “banking union” and which rules are part of the more general EU single market for financial services.</p>

          <h2>Rules and Institutions Applying to All EU Member States</h2>
          
          <p>On the one hand, there is European banking legislation that applies to all 28 EU member states. This includes the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the European Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD). This specific set of legislative texts is known as “EU single rulebook”, and lays down capital requirements for banks, ensures better protection for depositors, and regulates the prevention and management of bank failures respectively. Another example of EU-wide text is the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FICOD), which focuses on the supervision of complex financial groups.<br><br>Begin directives--rather than regulations--these pieces of legislation set EU-wide rules that are converted into national legislation and implemented by member state regulators. Similarly there are several pan-EU institutions that constitute the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), which is responsible for ensuring supervision of the whole Union’s financial system. The ESFS includes bodies such as the European Banking Authority, whose mandate is to produce a number of Binding Technical Standards (BTS) for the implementation of the CRD IV package and the BRRD. It also includes  the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system within the Union.</p>


          <h2>Rules and Institutions Applying to “Banking Union” Member States</h2>

          <p>Apart from EU-wide rules and institutions, there is a set of legislation and institutional arrangements known as Banking Union that currently applies only to the 19 euro area members. It is composed of three pillars.<br>The first pillar is the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). It was established by the SSM Regulation, which provides the ECB with powers on the supervision of a part of the European banking system.<br><br>The second pillar is the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), which in turn is comprised of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). Both the SRB (an independent EU agency) and the SRF were established by the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation. However, the funding of the SFR is regulated by the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) on the Transfer and Mutualization of Contributions to the Single Resolution Fund.<br>The third pillar, known as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), is still under construction. Even though, the Commission introduced a proposal for the scheme in November 2015, there are some member state policy-makers opposing it, notably in Germany.</p>

          <h2>Rules and Institutions Applying to EEA/EFTA Members</h2>
          <p>The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is composed of Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Switzerland participates in the European Union's single market through bilateral agreements. The other three EFTA countries participate through the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), which is formed by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway plus the 28 EU Members. The EEA joint committee has to decide whether a specific piece of EU legislation should be adopted into the EEA treaty, and therefore adopted by the three EFTA countries participating in the EEA (even though specific amendments can be made).<br><br>That is why non-EU countries as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland are transposing, for instance, the BRRD and DGSD into their national law. Because Switzerland does not participate in the EEA, it is not required to implement the BRRD (although in this case it decided to unilaterally introduce a regime with similar characteristics).<br><br>Not every EU financial legislation has been adopted in the EEA agreement. For example, the negotiations for adopting the regulation establishing the EBA have not concluded because being bounded by an external authority required constitutional changes in Norway.</p>


          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <p>This complex mix of legislation and institutions naturally can create confusion. Here are some frequently ask questions (please let us know if you come up with additional examples):</p>

          
            <h3>1) Do  non-Euro-area members participate in the Banking Union?</h3> 
            <p>Out of the 9 non-euro area members, 7 members (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Hungary, Poland, Romania) are obliged to join the Eurozone once convergence criteria are met. Since the participation in the banking union is automatic for Euro-area members, in the end all of these countries will be part of the banking union. However, it is possible to join the banking union before entering the eurozone, as some countries have  considered (see European banking union: should the ‘outs’ join in?). The two non-Euro-area members with an opt-out of the Euro (Denmark and United Kingdom) also have the possibility of joining the banking union without joining the euro. Though this appears to be a remote possibility.</p>

            <h3>2) How do national regulators interact with the  Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism?</h3>
            <p>European authorities (ECB and SRB for supervision and resolution respectively) are in charge of dealing with significant banks whereas the national authorities should deal with the less significant ones. However, both national and European authorities, working in close cooperation, compose the SSM and the SRM regimes (even though European-level authorities may have the last word regarding the supervision or resolution of any Euro-area bank).</p>
            
            <h3>3) Is the BRRD part of the Banking Union? </h3><p>As described by the EU Commission, the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive provides all EU authorities with more comprehensive and effective arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level. It sets out a minimum harmonised set of tools and powers, so that Member States would be able to introduce additional tools at national level to deal with crises...For Member States participating in the Banking Union, the Single Resolution Mechanism fully harmonises the range of available tools, setting out the institutional and funding architecture for applying those rules in Member States participating in the banking union. Therefore, Euro-area national and European authorities apply such tools in a much more harmonised way, but the BRRD itself goes beyond the banking union framework. The same logic applies to the other two texts that form the “single rulebook”, i.e. the Capital Requirements Directive/Regulation and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive</p>

            <h3>4) How are the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive and European Deposit Insurance Scheme related? </h3><p>Even though both pieces of legislation aim to construct European-wide deposit insurance, their scope is quite different. The DGSD is a directive adopted in 2010 and its goal is to harmonize the 27 different national schemes. For example, it requires that each scheme cover up to €100,000 of deposits. The implementation and, importantly, funding of each scheme remains with each of the 27 member states. On the other hand, the EDIS would be a Banking Union-wide institution pooling funding from banks across the Banking Union. Though, at present, it is just a EU Commission’s proposal that aims to create a single european deposit scheme for the euro-area members.</p>

            <h3>5) What is the difference between the EU-wide stress tests and the Asset Quality Review? </h3>
            <p>The Asset Quality Review is conducted by SSM authorities (ECB and National Authorities) and covers banking-union members. It tests the the resilience of banks’ balance sheets through an assessment of data quality, asset valuations, classifications of non-performing exposures, collateral valuation and provisions. On the other hand, EU-wide stress tests are coordinated by the EBA in cooperation with national authorities and the ECB. This exercises, which covers Euro and non-euro area members, are a forward-looking view of banks’ shock-absorption capacity under stress. Since, from the SSM perspective, not every euro-area significant bank is covered in this exercises, the ECB conducts in parallel its own stress test consistent with the EBA methodology for these banks.</p>

            <h3>6) Why is there an Intergovernmental Agreement for the  Single Resolution Fund? </h3>
            <p>The SRM Regulation establishes the Single Resolution Board (SRB) and the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). In the initial phase, the SRF is composed of national compartments. National authorities from participant member states will collect contributions from banks and will transfer them to these national compartments in a transitional period of 8 years. This mutualization of financial resources is regulated by an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) in order to avoid legal challenges that might derive from it.<br><br>Moreover, the IGA envisages the potential participation (and their contribution to the Fund) of the non-Euro area Member States. This is why the agreement was signed by the 26 EU member states (all except Sweden and the United Kingdom), although it only has been ratified by euro-area members as parts in the SRM.</p>
