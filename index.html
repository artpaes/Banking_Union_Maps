<h1>European Union Banking Integration Map Test</h1>


<div id="basic_map">
    <script src="js/basic_membership_map.js"></script>
</div>

<p>European bank regulatory integration consists of two groups of countries. The first are countries that have signed on to all of the provisions of what is know as the Banking Union. They have their largest banks supervised by the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Bank failures for these banks (and other banks that the ECB deems to be systemically important) are managed under the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). These countries are also part of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Currently, only Eurozone members are in the full Banking Union.</p>

<p>Other countries in the EU still have integrated their bank regulatory systems to a less, but still important degree. These countries interact with the Eurpean Banking Authority (EBA) and resolution of their failed banks is done under the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).</p>
