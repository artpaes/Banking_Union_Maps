<p>The European Banking Union really is two groups of countries. The first consists of countries that that have signed on to all of the Banking Union provisions. They have their largest banks supervised by the ECB under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Bank failures for these banks (and other banks that the ECB deems to be systemically important) are managed under the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). These countries are also part of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Currently, only Eurozone members are in the full Banking Union.</p>

<p>Other countries in the EU are in a weaker Banking Union. These countries interact with the Eurpean Banking Authority (EBA). Resolution of their failed banks is done under the Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).</p>
